##Hey there! :wave: Iâ€™m Oyewale Kofoworola, a curious mind exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Automation.
 I enjoy turning messy, unstructured data into clean, meaningful insights and building simple tools that make everyday tasks smarter.
 
I started my journey in finance, where I learned the power of data-driven decisions. Now, I combine that analytical background with my growing expertise in Python, AI models, and data processing to create solutions that automate, optimize, and inspire.
