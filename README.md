## Hi there 👋

<!--Hey there! :wave: I’m Oyewale Kofoworola, a curious mind exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence, Data, and Automation.
 I enjoy turning messy, unstructured data into clean, meaningful insights and building simple tools that make everyday tasks smarter.
I started my journey in finance, where I learned the power of data-driven decisions. Now, I combine that analytical background with my growing expertise in Python, AI models, and data processing to create solutions that automate, optimize, and inspire.
:computer: What I love working on:
Cleaning, validating, and structuring data
Creating an AI-powered chatbot dashboard using Streamlit
Automating workflows with Python
Web scraping and real-time data collection
Exploring AI models and Generative AI concepts
